# CardTemplateGenerator
Simple tool for generating card. Not the prettiest but it'll do.

A sample template is provided, with the ability to add more.

Current functionality:
- Adding a custom image
- Choosing "damage type" (the icon next to the attack number)
- Title and Description boxes automatically scale (down only) if the text is too big to fit
- Card preview
- Saving cards as PNG

TODO:
- Changing color scheme of cards through color pickers
- Move PNG outputting to a separate class
- Make more templates
